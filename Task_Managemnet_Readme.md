## Description:
-> The Task Management System is a Python application that helps users manage their day-to-day tasks. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as set deadlines and priorities. Users can organize their tasks into categories, making it easier to track and complete them efficiently.
-> The project provides an effective way to manage both personal and professional tasks. With this system, users can improve productivity and keep track of their work using simple Python logic and file handling.

## Features:

-> Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by specifying a title, description, priority, and deadline.

-> Task Editing: Modify existing tasks to change their details such as due date or priority.

-> Task Deletion: Remove tasks that are completed or no longer needed.

-> Task Categories: Organize tasks into different categories (e.g., work, personal).

-> View Tasks: List tasks by priority, due date, or category.

## Usage:

-> Users can create new tasks by specifying the task name, priority, and due date.
-> Tasks can be viewed in different categories or sorted by deadlines and priority levels.
-> Users can update or delete tasks as needed.
-> The system allows for efficient task tracking, improving time management and productivity.

## Technologies Used:

-> Python (for task management logic)
-> File handling (for saving and retrieving tasks)

## Future Enhancements:

-> Adding notifications for upcoming deadlines.
-> Synchronizing tasks across devices.
-> Implementing a calendar view for task deadlines.
