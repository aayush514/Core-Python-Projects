
## Project Name: Online Store

## Description:
-> The Online Store project is a Python-based e-commerce simulation. It allows users to browse through available products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The system manages inventory, ensuring that stock levels are maintained after each purchase. The aim is to provide a basic but functional store experience through the command-line interface.
-> This project is a great way to practice inventory management, user interactions, and payment processing (simulated) in Python. It provides a foundation for anyone wanting to learn about online shopping systems and e-commerce platforms.

## Features:

-> Product Browsing: Users can view a list of available products, including details such as name, description, price, and stock level.

-> Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their shopping cart, update quantities, and view the total price.

-> Inventory Management: The system automatically updates inventory levels when purchases are made, preventing out-of-stock sales.

-> Purchase Process: Users can proceed to checkout and complete the purchase by paying (simulated).

-> Error Handling: Ensures valid product selection, quantity management, and prevents purchasing items with insufficient stock.

## Usage:

-> Users can browse through the list of products available for purchase.
-> After selecting items, they can add them to their cart, update quantities, or remove products.
-> Once satisfied, users can proceed to checkout, where the system will calculate the total and confirm the purchase.
-> After purchasing, the inventory is updated, and users can continue shopping or exit the system.

## Technologies Used:

-> Python (for application logic and interface)
-> File handling (for product inventory storage)

## Future Enhancements:

-> Adding user accounts and wishlists.
-> Implementing real payment gateways.
-> Integrating a recommendation system based on user behavior.
