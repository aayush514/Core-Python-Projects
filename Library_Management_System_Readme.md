
## Project Name: Library Management System

## Description: 
-> The Library Management System is a Python project aimed at automating library tasks. It allows a librarian or a library administrator to manage books, borrowers, and transactions efficiently. The system provides a platform to manage inventory, issue books, accept returns, and track overdue books.
-> This project is an excellent tool for learning and implementing object-oriented programming principles in Python. It uses classes and objects to model books, users, and transactions.

## Features:

-> Book Management: Add, remove, or update books in the library’s collection.

-> Book Lending: Issue books to users with a due date for return.

-> Book Return: Accept returned books and update the inventory.

-> Overdue Tracking: Track books that have passed their due return date.

-> Inventory Management: View the complete inventory of books available in the library, including those that are currently issued.

## Usage:

-> Admins can add new books to the library collection by specifying details like the title, author, and quantity.
-> Users can borrow books from the library. The system keeps track of due dates and notifies the user if a book is overdue.
-> The system can also accept book returns and update the library’s inventory accordingly.
-> Admins can view the list of books currently issued or search for specific books.

## Technologies Used:

-> Python (for backend logic and user interface)
-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
-> File handling (for saving book records and transactions)

## Future Enhancements:

-> Adding user roles (e.g., librarian, member).
-> Implementing fine calculation for overdue books.
-> Incorporating a database for better scalability and performance.
