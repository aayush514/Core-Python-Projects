## Project Name: Banking System

## Description:
 The Banking System is a Python-based application that simulates the functionalities of a basic bank. Users can register and log into their accounts to manage their banking activities, including making deposits, withdrawing money, checking account balances, and viewing their transaction history. This system ensures security through user authentication and helps users manage their funds in a simplified way.

The project is designed to be simple yet functional for individuals looking to learn or apply Python for banking-related systems. It uses basic file handling for data persistence and operates entirely in the command-line interface (CLI).

## Features:

-> User Authentication: Each user can create an account and log in using a username and password.

-> Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can deposit funds into their accounts and withdraw money, provided they have sufficient balance.
-> Balance Inquiry: Users can check their current balance after logging into the system.
-> Transaction History: All transactions made by the user are stored and can be viewed at any time.
-> Error Handling: The system handles common errors like insufficient funds, invalid input, or account login failures.

## Usage:

-> Users must first register by providing their details.
-> After logging in, they can perform banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, and viewing transaction history.
-> To exit, users can log out or terminate the application.

## Technologies Used:

-> Python (for all logic and functionality)
-> File handling for data storage (e.g., for saving account and transaction details)

## Future Enhancements:

-> Implementing interest calculations.
-> Adding administrative functionalities like viewing all accounts.
-> Using a database for data persistence rather than file handling.
